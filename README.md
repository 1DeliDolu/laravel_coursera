# Laravel Coursera — Secure Authentication Course

Authentication is the first half of securing user access to your Laravel application. In this course, we’ll cover how to authenticate users in Laravel and the reasons why. We’ll discuss and examine the built-in Laravel authentication kits and explain which kit is best for which use case. Even if you have unique authentication requirements, Laravel’s authentication system can be used and we’ll show how with a custom authentication provider.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
